# Stew is a simple package manager for installing software outside of your
# distribution's repositories. It leverages the excellent GNU Stow utility to
# manage packages, but alleviates much of the boilerplate you might otherwise
# need to write if you wanted to automate your stow installations.

# A stew package is a shell script with the following properties:
#
#   * lives in a file named $name.pkg.sh in a directory in $pkgpath
#   * consists only of function and variable definitions (when run or sourced
#     it does nothing on its own)
#   * defines a `package` function which installs the software into $pkgdir
#     and runs stow on it 
#   * inherits the default implementation below

# This is the default implementation of the `package` function. You should not
# normally override this function. Instead, you should override the individual
# phases that it calls.
