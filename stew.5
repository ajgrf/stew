.Nm stew
.Nd package definition format for stew
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A
.Nm
package is a shell script with the following properties:
.Bl -bullet
.It
It lives in the file
.Va $name Ns .pkg.sh
in the
.Ev $STEWPKGS
directory.
.It
It consists only of functions and variable definitions
.Pq when run or sourced it does nothing on its own .
.It
It defines a
.Fn package
function which installs the software in
.Va $pkgdir
and runs stow on it.
.It
It inherits a default implementation from
.Pa stdenv.shlib .
.El
.Pp
.Sh PACKAGE PHASES
.Pa stdenv.shlib
defines a default implementation of the
.Fn package
function, which consists of a number distinct phases:
.Pp
.Bl -compact -offset Ds
.It
.Fn depends_phase
.It
.Fn download_phase
.It
.Fn setup_phase
.It
.Fn unpack_phase
.It
.Fn patch_phase
.It
.Fn configure_phase
.It
.Fn build_phase
.It
.Fn test_phase
.It
.Fn install_phase
.It
.Fn cleanup_phase
.It
.Fn stow_phase
.El
.Pp
You should not normally define your own
.Fn package
function.
Instead, you should override the individual phase that it calls.
If you just want to run some commands before or after a particular phase,
you can simply define a function named
.Li pre Ns Va $phase
or
.Li post Ns Va $phase .
For example,
.Fn preconfigure_phase
or
.Fn postbuild_phase .
.Nm
will automatically insert it into the correct position in the build.
.Pp
For a more complete understanding of the default
.Fn package
function, you should read
.Pa stdenv.shlib .
It's not long.
.Sh COMMON VARIABLES
These shell variables are interpreted by
.Nm
or its
.Pa stdenv.shlib :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Va name
The name of the package.
This is included in the package's
.Va $pkgdir .
.It Va version
The version number of the package.
.Nm
does not interpret this value, and has no idea how one version number
relates to another.
However, if defined it is also included in the package's
.Va $pkgdir .
.It Va description
A short description of the package.
This is shown when
.Nm
searches available packages.
.It Va depends
A whitespace-separated list of other stew packages that should be
installed first.
.It Va aptdepends
A whitespace-separated list of Debian packages that should be
installed first.
.It Va source
A whitespace-separated list of source files needed to build the package.
They may be local
.Pq in Ev $STEWPKGS ,
or remote.
Remote files may be suffixed with
.Ql > Ns Va $filename
to download to a specific destination filename.
.It Va sum
The corresponding checksums of the files in
.Va $source .
May be MD5, SHA1, SHA256, or SHA512 message digests.
.It Va gitrepo
A whitespace-separated list of git repositories to checkout.
May be suffixed with
.Ql @ Ns Va $revision
to specify a particular revision, tag, or branch to use.
.El
.Sh SHARING CODE
It's often useful to share code between multiple package definitions,
especially if they share a common build system.
By placing such code in
.Ev $STEWPKGS Ns Pa /foo.shlib ,
for example, you may then import it by calling the
.Fn use
function in your package definitions:
.Pp
.Dl use foo
